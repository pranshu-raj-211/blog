Hi, I'm **Pranshu Raj** — a backend engineer and systems thinker.

I use this space to write about building scalable systems, working with real-time infrastructure, and making tools that help me (and hopefully others) think and work better.

I tinker with real-time systems, build tools to offload thinking, and chase the balance between speed, simplicity, and usefulness.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Tech deep dives** — performance tuning, real-time systems, backend tricks.
- **Build logs** — documenting how I approach and ship personal projects.
- **Tools & automations** — things I build to reduce friction in life and work.
- **Ideas & reflections** — learning in public, experimenting with structure and focus.

I keep my rough notes in a separate [website](https://pranshu-raj-211.github.io)

## About This Site
